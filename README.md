# Football_Player_Free_Transfer
The goal from this toy project is to make use of available football data in favor of football players willing to make a career plan that maximises their money income.<br>
The idea here comes from the fact that players who come as free agents get a better salary and a good signing bonus.<br>
So, from the available data about football players performance, age, market value and contract details, I will make an analysis of the players that benifited financially from going out as a free agent. And also, I will try to find a pattern when it comes to the seasons before and after the transfer.
